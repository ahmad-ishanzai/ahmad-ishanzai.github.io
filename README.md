I'm currently majoring in both my Master's in Computer Science & English at Acme Collins School. Hopefully I'll be working on my PhD in Computer Science soon & also become a professor. I've been working on developing my own programming language called Project: CherryScript Programming Language & below are the list of commands that it's designed to have based off of other programming languages:

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown of Project: CherryScript Programming Language 

Syntax highlighted code block

Python commands:

Declaring variables:

x = 5

y = "John"

Print:

x = 5

y = "John" Print(x) Print(y)

Taking input

Value = input ("Please enter a string:\n") Print ('You entered {value}')

Lists

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] print(thislist) 

Dictionaries thisdict = { "brand": "Ford",

"model": "Mustang", "year": 1964

}

Tuples
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry") print(thistuple)

Sets

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"} print(thisset)
Functions

def my_function(): print("Hello from a function") 

my_function() 

Java commands:

Declaring class:

public class MyFirstJavaProgram

{ 

public static void main(String []args)

{

System.out.println("Hello World");

}

}

Printing:

System.out.println("Hello World");

Constructor

class Test { Test() { // constructor body } }

Method

modifier returnType nameOfMethod (Parameter List) { // method body }

My SQL commands:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE Students; mysql> USE Students

mysql> CREATE TABLE Information (firstname VARCHAR(20),lastname VARCHAR(20),gender CHAR(1),grade INT(10), dob DATE);

mysql> SHOW TABLES;

mysql> INSERT INTO Information VALUES ('Amanda','Williams','f','10','1999-03-30'); mysql> INSERT INTO Information VALUES ('Peter','Williams','m','10','1998-03-15');

mysql> INSERT INTO Information VALUES ('Cristie','Wills','f','10','1999-02-05');

PHP Commands:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<body>

<h1>Developer News</h1>

<?php echo "The Best PHP Examples"; ?>

</body>

</html>

<?php

// This is a single-line comment

# You can also make single-line comments like this

?>

<?php

/*

This comment block spans over multiple

lines

*/

?>

```

I'll keep you updated on the process of the official release date of "CherryScript" & if anyone has any feedback, please be sure to follow up with me soon... :) Thank you!!
